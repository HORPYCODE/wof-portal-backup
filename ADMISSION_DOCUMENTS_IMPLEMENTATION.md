## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
project/
├── admission_letter.php          # Admission letter display and print page
├── download_guarantor_form.php   # Guarantor form download handler
├── dashboard.php                 # Updated with download buttons

```

### Database Integration
The system uses the existing database schema:
- `applications` table: Stores student application data
- `cohorts` table: Contains training cohort information
- `users` table: User authentication and identification

### Security Features
1. Authentication required for all document access
2. Application ownership verification
3. Status verification (only approved applications can access documents)
4. Secure file path handling

## User Workflow

### For Students:
1. Student applies to a cohort
2. Admin reviews and approves application
3. Student sees approved status on dashboard
4. Two download buttons appear:
   - "View & Download Admission Letter" (opens in new tab)
   - "Download Guarantor's Form" (direct download)
5. Student can print admission letter as PDF from browser
6. Student downloads guarantor's form directly

### Admission Letter Content:
- Reference number (auto-generated)
- Date of issue
- Student's address
- Congratulatory message
- Admission details box with:
  - Student Number
  - Course of Study
  - Cohort Name
  - Duration
  - Commencement Date
  - Class Session
- Requirements for resumption
- Official signature section
- Footer with contact information

## Course Mapping
The system maps course codes to full course names:
- desktop_publishing → Desktop Publishing
- graphics_design_ui_ux → Graphics Design - UI/UX
- web_design → Web Design
- digital_marketing → Digital Marketing/Content Creation
- photography_video_editing → Photography/Video Editing
- frontend_development → Front-End Software Development
- backend_development → Back-End Software Development
- fullstack_development → Fullstack Software Development
- mobile_app_development → Mobile App Development
- data_analytics → Data Analytics

## Session Time Mapping
- morning_10_12 → Morning (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
- afternoon_230_430 → Afternoon (2:30 PM - 4:30 PM)
- weekends_8_1 → Weekends only (8:00 AM - 1:00 PM)

## Browser Print-to-PDF
The admission letter page includes:
- Print-optimized CSS with proper page margins
- Print button that triggers browser's print dialog
- Users can save as PDF using their browser's "Save as PDF" option
- Back to Dashboard button for easy navigation

## Future Enhancements
1. Server-side PDF generation using Composer/Dompdf (when Composer is available)
2. Email delivery of admission letters
3. Document tracking in database (record when documents are generated/downloaded)
4. Digital signatures for admission letters
5. Batch document generation for administrators

## Notes
- The guarantor's form is a static PDF document
- The admission letter is dynamically generated from application data
- Student numbers are generated using a hash-based approach for uniqueness
- All documents are secured behind authentication
- The system uses browser's native print-to-PDF for document generation (no external dependencies required)
