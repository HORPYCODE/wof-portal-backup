## Known Limitations

1. **PDF Generation**: Currently uses browser's print-to-PDF feature. For automated server-side PDF generation, Composer and Dompdf package need to be installed.

2. **Student Number**: Uses MD5 hash for uniqueness. For production, consider using database auto-increment with proper formatting.

3. **Logo Display**: Logo path is hardcoded. Ensure `images/wof_logo_png.png` exists or update the path.
